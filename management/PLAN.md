# Project Plan: Optical attosecond spectroscopy of disordered media

**Last Sync:** 2026-01-12

## Status: 🟡 (Caution – Endgame Phase)
*Rationale:* The generalized Drude model has been validated for both weakly disordered crystals and amorphous silicon—a major success. DOS extraction is working. The thesis deadline (2026-03-01) is approaching rapidly (~7 weeks). We are now in the **physics clarification endgame**: extracting maximum insight from existing simulations, deciding the fate of the dipole oscillations (FID) analysis, and constructing a coherent narrative. The risk is that we attempt too much refinement and fail to consolidate findings into a clear thesis story.

## Active Workflows

### Current Path: Physics Extraction & Narrative Finalization
*Rationale:* The orthogonal pump-probe protocol successfully isolates carrier transport from photoinjection. The variable-effective-mass Drude model captures the essential physics across disorder regimes. The central scientific claim is emerging: **disorder modifies ultrafast transport primarily by altering the effective mass landscape and creating more uniform band population, not by introducing qualitatively new physics**. The immediate challenge is to quantitatively connect this to the DOS, investigate whether disorder affects the *energy distribution* of photoinjected carriers (not just transport), and make a final decision on whether dipole oscillations merit inclusion in the thesis.

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1.  **[IN PROGRESS]** **Dipole Oscillations (FID) Decision Point:** Vlad is personally experimenting with Fourier and time-frequency analysis on data files provided by Trofim (ideal crystal, weakly disordered crystal, amorphous Si). This will determine within days whether this research line continues or is terminated. **Decision required by mid-January 2026.**
2.  **Carrier Concentration Extraction:** Trofim to clarify whether SALMON saves energies from diagonalizing the perturbed Hamiltonian (in addition to occupations of Bloch states projected from single-electron wavefunctions). If yes, extract carrier concentrations to decouple effective mass from carrier density in the Drude model.
3.  **Disorder Dependency Plots:** Trofim to systematically plot $\gamma(s)$, $m^*(s)$, and $\alpha(s)$ where $s$ quantifies disorder (RMS atomic displacement or SOAP metric). Goal: quantify the statement "more disorder → less mass variation."
4.  **Energy Distribution Analysis:** Investigate whether disorder alters the energy distribution of carriers generated by two-photon absorption. Does disorder preferentially populate high-energy or low-energy states? This connects DOS changes to transport observations.
5.  **DOS-Transport Link:** Attempt quantitative connection: can the DOS broadening width predict the mass variation parameter $\alpha$? This is speculative but could provide deep physical insight.

## Strategic Context

### Core Hypothesis
Disorder influences femtosecond-scale nonlinear optical response primarily by modifying the **transport** of photoinjected carriers, not the injection process itself. The orthogonal pump-probe geometry isolates this transport regime. Observable effects are captured by a Drude model with time-dependent effective mass $m^*(t) \propto A^4(t)$, where disorder:
- Increases momentum relaxation rate $\gamma$
- Reduces the *variation* in effective mass required to fit data (due to more uniform conduction band population in amorphous structures)
- Smoothes and broadens the DOS

This framework applies to both weakly disordered crystals and fully amorphous silicon, suggesting a continuous, rather than qualitatively distinct, evolution of transport physics with disorder.

### Key Uncertainties
*   **Dipole Signature (Critical, resolution imminent):** Does disorder leave a distinct qualitative signature in the dipole oscillations (FID) beyond generic ensemble dephasing? If no clear signal emerges, this line will be dropped from the thesis to conserve time.
*   **Microscopic Origin (Open):** Can the observed DOS smoothing/broadening quantitatively predict the transport model parameters ($\alpha$, $m^*$)? Or is the connection only qualitative?
*   **Energy Distribution (Open):** Does disorder alter the energy distribution of photoinjected carriers? This would provide a critical missing link between DOS changes and transport observations.
*   **Photoinjection Dynamics (Low priority):** Initial time-domain investigations showed no qualitative differences. Energy-domain analysis may reveal subtle effects, but this is not critical for the thesis narrative.

### Success Criteria for Thesis Completion
By **mid-February 2026**, Trofim must have:
1. Quantitative disorder-dependence plots for all model parameters
2. Clear decision on FID analysis (include or exclude)
3. Preliminary energy distribution results (if feasible within 2 weeks of effort)
4. Draft thesis outline with figures

The thesis narrative is: **"Orthogonal pump-probe TDDFT reveals that disorder modifies ultrafast carrier transport via effective mass renormalization and momentum relaxation, captured by a generalized Drude model. DOS broadening correlates with transport changes."**
